DESCRIPTION:
Defining basic traits for AST operations


TYPES:
ReadError - Error occured while reading the document and parsing it to the pandoc AST format
WriteError - Error occured while writting the document from the Pandoc AST format 

TRAITS:
AstReader - Trait for AST reading operations
AstWriter - Trait for AST writting operations (implemented for typstWriter, latexWriter)


FUNCTIONS:
write(&mut self, ast: Pandoc) -> Result<String, Self::WriteError> - method outputing a document according to the created pandoc AST

read(str: String) -> Result<Pandoc, Self::ReadError> - method for creating the pandoc AST from a document
